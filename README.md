# MongoDB Atlas Local Library

A Rust library for managing MongoDB Atlas Local deployments using Docker. This library provides a high-level interface to interact with MongoDB Atlas Local deployments, making it easy to develop and test applications against a local MongoDB Atlas environment.

## Overview

MongoDB Atlas Local Library simplifies the process of managing MongoDB Atlas Local deployments by providing a Rust-native interface that abstracts away the complexity of Docker container management. Whether you're developing applications that will eventually run against MongoDB Atlas or testing Atlas-specific features locally, this library provides the tools you need.

## Features

- Docker Integration: Seamlessly manages MongoDB Atlas Local deployments through Docker
- Rust Native: Built specifically for Rust applications with idiomatic APIs
- Simple Setup: Easy to integrate into existing Rust projects
- Development Ready: Perfect for local development and testing workflows

## Installation

Since this library is not yet published to crates.io, you need to add it as a Git dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
atlas-local-lib = { git = "https://github.com/mongodb/atlas-local-lib" }
```

For development and testing, you may also want to include tokio:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
```

## Prerequisites

Before using this library, make sure you have:

- **Docker**: Docker must be installed and running on your system
- **Rust**: Rust 1.70 or later (edition 2024)

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```rust,no_run
use bollard::Docker;
use atlas_local::Client;
use atlas_local::models::CreateDeploymentOptions;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Connect to Docker daemon
    let docker = Docker::connect_with_socket_defaults()?;

    // Create a new MongoDB Atlas Local client
    let client = Client::new(docker);

    // Create a deployment
    client.create_deployment(&CreateDeploymentOptions::default()).await?;

    // List the running deployments
    let deployments = client.list_deployments().await.unwrap();

    // Print the deployments
    for deployment in deployments {
        println!("[{}] \t{}", deployment.mongodb_version, deployment.name.unwrap_or_default());
    }

    // Delete the new deployment
    client.delete_deployment("local1234").await?;

    Ok(())
}
```

More examples can be found in `examples/*` and ran using `cargo run --example [example-name]`
